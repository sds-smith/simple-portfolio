              the users and owners of our software, while also leaving a codebase
              for fellow developers that is clean, maintainable, and scalable.
              Nothing is more important to the health of a codebase than quality
              code, but it means nothing if it doesn&rsquo;t produce real value
              for the users and owners of our software in real time. &nbsp;Our
              challenge, then, is to produce quality code at the speed of
