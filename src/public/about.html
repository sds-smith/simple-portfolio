                <h2>Driven by Purpose, Guided by Curiosity</h2>
                <p>I like to solve tough problems. I want to work on challenging projects that make a difference for others, surrounded by people smarter than me who inspire me. I love to build things that work, complex things designed with simplicity and elegance.</p>
                <p>I believe in first listening to understand needs, perspectives, and obstacles, then formulating a response to meet those needs, overcome the obstacles and honor perspectives.</p>
                <p>Software is about people - the people who use it and the people who develop and maintain it. As a Software Engineer, I put people first, crafting solutions around their needs, choosing technologies that fit the solution.</p>
                <p>I believe it's our job as developers to produce real and measurable results for business owners, while also leaving a codebase for fellow and future developers that is clean, maintainable, and extensible. There is nothing more important to the health of a codebase than clean code/ clean architecture, but it means nothing if it doesn't produce real value for the customer right now.</p>
                <p>I am guided by a lifelong curiosity and tireless desire to be better today than yesterday, better tomorrow than today.</p>
