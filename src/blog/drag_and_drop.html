    <span 
      >A few years ago I developed a small web app that my family uses to
      exchange gift ideas. It&rsquo;s just a small React frontend backed by a
      document database. Each of us (my wife, our two kids and I) maintains a
      wish list in the app that the others can view on our phones as a
      vertical stack of individual item cards.</span

  <p >
    <span 
      >Recently my son Nathan presented me with some new
      &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; for the application, chief among them the
      ability to re-order his list by priority. Specifically, he wanted to
      have the ability to grab an individual item card and move it to a new
      position within the list.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p >
    <span 
      >Why not? The app was due for a reexamination and update anyway. I
      seized the opportunity to clean up the architecture and logic a bit,
      upgrade to React 19 and replace the original Chakra-UI components with
      MaterialUI. I then developed some of the simpler new features like the
      ability to categorize and the ability to list a price. Finally I was
      ready to consider the heavy lift of implementing drag-and-drop to
      re-order a wish list.

    <span
      >Implementing drag and drop functionality is not a simple endeavor.
      However, its use-cases are becoming more and more ubiquitous as users
      increasingly expect to be able to interact with the UI in this way. It
      will be good to get my hands dirty with this and have at least one
      drag-and-drop strategy in my toolbelt.</span

    <span >The Browser&rsquo;s built-in Drag and Drop API</span>
  </h3>
  <p >
    <span 
      >When I think of drag-and-drop UI elements (like cards for instance),
      the first thing that comes to mind is Atlassian products like Jira.
      Atlassian uses their own (open-source) JavaScript &nbsp;library called
      Pragmatic Drag and Drop. I go to their docs but I don&rsquo;t even get
      past the intro paragraph before a reference is made to the
      browser&rsquo;s built-in drag and drop API. Maybe I should check that
      out first.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p >
    <span>I head over to the MDN Docs site and read up on the </span
    ><span 
      ><a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API"
        >HTML Drag and Drop API</a
      ></span
    ><span 
      >. Ok, after reading I&rsquo;m glad to have gained a little background
      understanding on the underlying API but it&rsquo;s clear I&rsquo;ll be
      using a library for this.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p >
    <span 
      >The native API involves a number of concepts, including the draggable
      element, drop target, underlying data to be mutated, and seven different
      drag events. There&rsquo;s an in-browser drag data store and special
      properties of the drag event like dataTransfer and target.ownerDocument
      to name just two. Some elements are draggable by default while others
      need to have their `draggable` attribute set to true. And of course we
      would need to define drag behavior with handlers for the many events on
      not only the draggable element but also the drop target element.</span

  </p>
  <p >
    <span 
      >It might be worthwhile at a later date to try my hand at a custom
      solution that leverages this API, but today I&rsquo;ll opt to get my
      feet wet with a library that abstracts much of this away.</span
